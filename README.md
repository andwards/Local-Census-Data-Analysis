# Local Census Data Analysis

## Problem
* Census data for local communities is spread out across many data sources/websites.
* This makes it difficult for the average citizen to access data about their community, and find out ways the community needs support and resources.

## Research Question
* What's the growth of Eastern North Carolina compared to the rest of the state?
    * North Carolina is considered to be one of the fastest growing states, but is growth equally distributed?
    * Wich areas are falling behind compared to the rest of the state?
    * Are we performing well compared to other NC areas, if well, does this come at a cost?
    * What ethnic groups are moving in versus out?
    * What do income levels look like per ethnic group?

## Dataset

Population tables:
* have a population table for each state
* split population into date tables
* have a population table where it has population for each county in North Carolina for 2019 and 2015
* separate into respective ethnic groups
* counties in inner banks (ENC)(REGION 1)
* counites in outer banks (ENC)(REGION 1)
* counties in southeast (ENC)(REGION 2)
* counties in sandhills (ENC)(REGION 3)
* counties in triangle (MIDDLE)(REGION 4)
* counties in piedmont triad (MIDDLE)(REGION 5)
* counties in metrolina (MIDDLE)(REGION 6)
* counties in mountains (WESTERN)(REGION 7)

note: REGION refers to economical areas
i.e. inner banks and outers banks are separate geographic areas but considered part of the same economical region

Economic tables:
* total expenditure per county
* total investment per county and split into separate industries
* gross earnings per county and broken down into ethnic groups
* total renting per county broken down into ethnic groups 
* total house buying per county broken down into ethnic groups

Data Cleaning
* Drop unneeded columns
* Rename used columns
* Update the values (i.e. country_name)
* Categorize the data (i.e. race)
* Add column that bins age groups

## Visualizations
* Power BI was used for creating visualizations.
* Some features utilized:
    * DAX formulas
    * Calculated Columns
    * Shape Maps
    * Filters and Slicers
